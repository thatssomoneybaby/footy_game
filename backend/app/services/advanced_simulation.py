Advanced AFL Match Simulation Engine

This engine uses ALL player attributes to create realistic match simulations:

TECHNICAL ATTRIBUTES IMPACT:
- Kicking: Goal accuracy, field kicking precision, turnover rate
- Handball: Short passing chains, ball movement speed
- Marking: Contested marks, intercept marks, forward targets
- Spoiling: Defensive pressure, turnover creation
- Ruck work: Hit-out advantage, clearance dominance

PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES IMPACT:  
- Speed: Breakaway goals, defensive recovery, transition play
- Endurance: 4-quarter performance consistency, late game impact
- Strength: Contested ball wins, physical matchup advantages

MENTAL ATTRIBUTES IMPACT:
- Decision making: Disposal efficiency, tactical execution
- Leadership: Team chemistry multiplier, clutch performance
- Composure: Pressure situations, goal accuracy under pressure

MATCH SIMULATION FEATURES:
- Quarter-by-quarter progression with fatigue
- Individual player performance tracking
- Dynamic momentum shifts
- Weather and ground conditions
- Tactical adjustments based on team composition
- Injury risk modeling
- Match statistics generation
